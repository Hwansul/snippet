#### func println

```go
func println(args ...Type)
```

The println built-in function formats its arguments in an
implementation-specific way and writes the result to standard error.
Spaces are always added between arguments and a newline is appended.
Println is useful for bootstrapping and debugging; it is not guaranteed
to stay in the language.
