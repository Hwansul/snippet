/* Expose the tests as a live collaborative document */

/**
 * Besides increasing app reliability, tests bring another attractive opportunity to the table - serve as live app documentation. 
 * Since tests inherently speak at a less-technical and product/UX language, using the right tools they can serve as a communication artifact that greatly aligns all the peers - developers and their customers. 
 * 
 * For example, some frameworks allow expressing the flow and expectations (i.e. tests plan) using a human-readable language so any stakeholder, including product managers, can read, approve and collaborate on the tests which just became the live requirements document. 
 * This technique is also being referred to as 'acceptance test' as it allows the customer to define his acceptance criteria in plain language. This is [BDD (behavior-driven testing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) at its purest form. 
 * 
 * One of the popular frameworks that enable this is [Cucumber which has a JavaScript flavor](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), see example below. Another similar yet different opportunity, [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/), allows exposing UI components as a graphic catalog 
 * where one can walk through the various states of each component (e.g. render a grid w/o filters, render that grid with multiple rows or with none, etc), see how it looks like, and how to trigger that state - this can appeal also to product folks but mostly serves as live doc for developers who consume those components.

 * ❌ Otherwise
 * After investing top resources on testing,

// ✅Doing It Right Example: 
// Describing tests in human-language using cucumber-js

```text
This is how one can describe tests using cucumber: plain language that allows anyone to understand and collaborate

Feature: Twitter new tweet

  I want to tweet something in Twitter

  @focus
  Scenario: Tweeting from the home page
    Given I open Twitter home
    Given I click on "New tweet" button
    Given I type "Hello followers!" in the textbox
    Given I click on "Submit" button
    Then I see message "Tweet saved"
```

// ✅Doing It Right Example: 
// Visualizing our components, their various states and inputs using Storybook.
