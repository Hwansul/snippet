/* Copy code, but only what's neccessary */

/**
 * ✅Do
 * Include all the necessary details that affect the test result, but nothing more.
 * As an example, consider a test that should factor 100 lines of input JSON - Pasting this in every test is tedious. * Extracting it outside to transferFactory.
 * getJSON() will leave the test vague - Without data, it's hard to correlate the test result with the cause ("why is it supposed to return 400 status?"). 
 * 
 * The classic book x-unit patterns named this pattern 'the mystery guest' - Something unseen affected our test results, we don't know what exactly.
 * We can do better by extracting repeatable long parts outside AND mentioning explicitly which specific details matter to the test.
 * Going with the example above, the test can pass parameters that highlight what is important: transferFactory.getJSON({ sender: undefined }).
 * In this example, the reader should immediately infer that the empty sender field is the reason why the test should expect a validation error or any other similar adequate outcome.

/**
 * ❌ Otherwise
 * Copying 500 JSON lines in will leave your tests unmaintainable and unreadable.
 * Moving everything outside will end with vague tests that are hard to understand
