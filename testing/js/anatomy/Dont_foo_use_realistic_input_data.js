/* Don’t “foo”, use realistic input data */

/**
 * ✅Do
 * Often production bugs are revealed under some very specific and surprising input — the more realistic the test input is, the greater the chances are to catch bugs early.
 * Use dedicated libraries like[Chance](https://github.com/chancejs/chancejs) or [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) to generate pseudo-real data that resembles the variety and form of production data. 
 * For example, such libraries can generate realistic phone numbers, usernames, credit cards, company names, and even ‘lorem ipsum’ text. 
 * You may also create some tests (on top of unit tests, not as a replacement) that randomize fakers' data to stretch your unit under test or even import real data from your production environment. Want to take it to the next level? See the next bullet (property-based testing).
 */

/**
 * ❌ Otherwise
 * All your development testing will falsely show green when you use synthetic inputs like “Foo”, 
 * but then production might turn red when a hacker passes -in a nasty string like “@3e2ddsf. ##’ 1 fdsfds.fds432 AAAA”
