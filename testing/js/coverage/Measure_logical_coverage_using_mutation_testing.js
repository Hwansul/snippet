/* Measure logical coverage using mutation testing */


/**
 * ✅ Do
 * The Traditional Coverage metric often lies: 
 * It may show you 100 % code coverage, but none of your functions, even not one, return the right response.
 * How come ? it simply measures over which lines of code the test visited, but it doesn’t check if the tests actually tested anything — asserted for the right response.
 * Like someone who’s traveling for business and showing his passport stamps — this doesn’t prove any work done, only that he visited few airports and hotels.
 * 
 * Mutation - based testing is here to help by measuring the amount of code that was actually TESTED not just VISITED. 
 * [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) is a JavaScript library for mutation testing and the implementation is really neat:
 * 
 * (1) it intentionally changes the code and “plants bugs”.
 *     For example the code newOrder.price === 0 becomes newOrder.price != 0. 
 *     This “bugs” are called mutations
 * 
 * (2) it runs the tests, if all succeed then we have a problem
 *      — the tests didn’t serve their purpose of discovering bugs, the mutations are so 
 *     - called survived. If the tests failed, then great, the mutations were killed.
 * 
 * Knowing that all or most of the mutations were killed gives much higher confidence 
 * than traditional coverage and the setup time is similar

/**
 * ❌ Otherwise
 * You’ll be fooled to believe that 85 % coverage means your test will detect bugs in 85 % of your code
 */

// ❌ Anti-Pattern Example: 
// 100% coverage, 0% testing

function addNewOrder(newOrder) {
  logger.log(`Adding new order ${newOrder}`);
  DB.save(newOrder);
  Mailer.sendMail(newOrder.assignee, `A new order was places ${newOrder}`);

  return { approved: true };
}

it("Test addNewOrder, don't use such test names", () => {
  addNewOrder({ assignee: "John@mailer.com", price: 120 });
}); //Triggers 100% code coverage, but it doesn't check anything

// ✅Doing It Right Example: 
// Stryker reports, a tool for mutation testing, detects and counts the amount of code that is not tested (Mutations)
