/* Get enough coverage for being confident, ~80% seems to be the lucky number */

/**
 * ✅ Do
 * The purpose of testing is to get enough confidence for moving fast, obviously the more code is tested the more confident the team can be.
 * Coverage is a measure of how many code lines (and branches, statements, etc) are being reached by the tests.
 *
 * So how much is enough? 10–30% is obviously too low to get any sense about the build correctness,
 * on the other side 100% is very expensive and might shift your focus from the critical paths to the exotic corners of the code.
 *
 * The long answer is that it depends on many factors like the type of application — if you’re building the next generation of Airbus A380 than 100% is a must, for a cartoon pictures website 50% might be too much.
 *
 * Although most of the testing enthusiasts claim that the right coverage threshold is contextual, most of them also mention the number 80% as a thumb of a rule ([Fowler: “in the upper 80s or 90s”](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)) that presumably should satisfy most of the applications.
 *
 * Implementation tips:
 * You may want to configure your continuous integration(CI) to have a coverage threshold([Jest link](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoverage-boolean)) and stop a build that doesn’t stand to this standard (it’s also possible to configure threshold per component, see code example below).
 * On top of this, consider detecting build coverage decrease (when a newly committed code has less coverage) — this will push developers raising or at least preserving the amount of tested code. All that said, coverage is only one measure, a quantitative based one, that is not enough to tell the robustness of your testing.
 * And it can also be fooled as illustrated in the next bullets

/**
 * ❌ Otherwise
 * Confidence and numbers go hand in hand, without really knowing that you tested most of the system — there will also be some fear and fear will slow you down

// ✅ Doing It Right Example: 
// Setting up coverage per component (using Jest)

// Example: A typical coverage report
