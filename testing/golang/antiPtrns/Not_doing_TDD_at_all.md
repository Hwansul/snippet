## Not doing TDD at all

Of course, it is possible to write great software without TDD but, a lot of problems I've seen with the design of code and the quality of tests would be very difficult to arrive at if a disciplined approach to TDD had been used.

One of the strengths of TDD is that it gives you a formal process to break down problems, understand what you're trying to achieve (red), get it done (green), then have a good think about how to make it right (blue/refactor).

Without this, the process is often ad-hoc and loose, which _can_ make engineering more difficult than it _could_ be.
