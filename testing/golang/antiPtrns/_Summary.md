## Summary

Most problems with unit tests can normally be traced to:

- Developers not following the TDD process
- Poor design

So, learn about good software design!

The good news is TDD can help you _improve your design skills_ because as stated in the beginning:

**TDD's main purpose is to provide feedback on your design.** For the millionth time, listen to your tests, they are reflecting your design back at you.

Be honest about the quality of your tests by listening to the feedback they give you, and you'll become a better developer for it.
