## Prerequisite material

The inspiration for this chapter is borne of many years of frustration with acceptance tests. Two videos I would recommend you watch are:

- Dave Farley - [How to write acceptance tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDD5EEJgpHU)
- Nat Pryce - [E2E functional tests that can run in milliseconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk4rCn4YLLU)

"Growing Object Oriented Software" (GOOS) is such an important book for many software engineers, including myself. The approach it prescribes is the one I coach engineers I work with to follow.

- [GOOS](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com) - Nat Pryce & Steve Freeman

Finally, [Riya Dattani](https://twitter.com/dattaniriya) and I spoke about this topic in the context of BDD in our talk, [Acceptance tests, BDD and Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMWJCk_0WrY).
